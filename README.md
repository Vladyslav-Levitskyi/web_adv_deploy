This is a web application builded on Django. There are three main applications:  'web_adv_deploy', 'core_app' and 'register'. First of them is initializes and has all server settings that we need. Also 'web_adv_deploy' has root 'urls.py' file that required for all HTML templates to work. Second application called 'core_app' is for static files like CSS, images or JavaScript. Besides 'core_app' has own templates include 'layout.html' - main layout template. Third 'register' application and the name speaks for itself, this app is for registration and login, we will use UserCreationForm in 'register/views.py' file for this purpose.
